    <h2> What is Market Segmentation?</h2>
        <section> Market segmentation is the process of dividing a target market into smaller,
         more defined categories. It segments customers into groups that share
          similar characteristics such as demographics,
         interests, needs, or location.</section>
   <h3>When should you use market segmentation?</h3>
     <ul>
       <li>Customers cannot be reached effectively with the same marketing strategy</li>
       <li>There are identifiable and divisible segments</li>
       <li>You must be able to compare the market segments in terms of sales potential, costs and profits</li>
       <li>One segment must have enough profit potential to justify developing a special marketing mix</li>
       <li> Differentiate you service from competitors </li>
        <li>Identify the most effective marketing tactics </li>
