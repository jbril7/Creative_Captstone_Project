      <h1> What is Marketing?</h1>
      <p>The activity and process for creating,
        communicating and delivering information about your service
        that have <b>value</b> for customers, clients, partners, and society at large.</p>
     <h2> What makes services marketing different? </h2>
      <h3>Intangible | Perishable | Heterogeneous </h3>
        <h4>In other words...</h4>
    <section>Unlike product marketing which refers to goods that are physical and can be touched,
     services are <b>intangible</b> and cannot be held or touched.<br><br>
     Services also cannot be saved for later like most goods can and reach a point of optimum capacity
     rather than running out of stock. For instance, the effects of services <b>perishability</b> is experienced by the customer when they miss a
     flight. The customer will never be able to purchase that exact service again since services are produced
      at the samee time they are consumed.<br><br>
     Services are also <b>heterogeneous</b> which means that every customers experience is going to be different.
     Unlike goods, services involve customers direct interaction with the people, processes and phsical enviorment of the company.</section>

  <h2>Why is Marketing Important?</h2>
     <h3> Someone cannot try your service if they have not heard about it!</h3>
          <p>Marketing solves this problem by increasing awarness of your service,
            while informing customers about the values your service can provide to them. The world is filled with marketing
           and advertisements trying to pursuade people why their service is the right pick for them.
